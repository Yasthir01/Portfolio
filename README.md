# Portfolio

After completing a degree in Forensic Science and Technology, I decided to become a self taught programmer. I started off with Python programming and learnt many other languages along the way. I gained an interest in Machine Learning and Data Science and decided to complete a Data Science bootcamp. 

Some of my skills include Python, Machine Learning, Data Science, JavaScript, HTML and CSS, Ethical Hacking.
